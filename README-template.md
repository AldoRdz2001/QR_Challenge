## My process

### Built with

- Add Normalize.css.
- Make the structure of html.
- Import the css files.
- Import the font.
- Create global variables in style.css
- Create the container.
- Add the image and syle of the paragraph.

### What I learned

I'm proun of center a div, cause was dificult for me.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.contenedor {
    width: min(90%, 35rem);
    margin: 11rem auto;
    background-color: var(--white);
    padding: 2rem;
    border-radius: 5%;
}
```

### Continued development

I wanna use more JS for more animations and things, or get better understanding of CSS and tricks.
